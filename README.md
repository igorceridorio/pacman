Development of a Pacman game using three.js.

For the logic of the game, pure Javasccript was used. The graphics were created with three.js. I also used a couple libraries:

  - trackballControls.js;
  - stats.min.js;
  - threex.pacman.js;
  - sweetalert.js.

The main goal is to run this project in desktops, but simple touch control was added so it can be executed in tablets and smartphones as well.
